	bi - brainfuck interpreter

	This repository holds the source code for a brainfuck interpreter
	written in x64 assembly language, there's not too much to say
	about it since it works as any other interpreter, just provide
	a brainfuck file and see the magic :)

	If you want to try it, run the following commands in your terminal

	$ cd source
	$ make
	$ ./bi "$(cat <file>)"

	You cannot pass the file directly since the program does not
	read files, it just works with the first argument given.
