	bi - brainfuck interpreter

	This is my bf interpreter implementation in x64 for the seek
	of learning and fun :)

	The idea is rather simple, that's why this project does not contain
	any 'IMP' file as all my other projects do; I just followed the rules
	brainfuck has (see ref 1)

	References:
	1. Brainfuck rules:                          https://brainfuck.org/epistle.html
	2. Where does the .bf files come from?       https://brainfuck.org/

	If you do not like interpreters but rather compilers targeting x64
	see my 'bc' project which is a brainfuck compiler ;)
